TIM3 - An IoT Timer which syncs with Google Calendar and a custom Web App to countdown to your "Next Big Thing!" :D

Uses:
1. If someone invites you to a meeting or tags you on an event through Google Calendar, the countdown begins for the start time!

2. Ability to sync with 3rd Party APIs to track deliveries of your packages etc. (in-progress)

I have used Google Firebase Firestore, Python with Flask as an API Handler and deployed it on Microsoft Azure
